TUD SS20 tractography
Team's diary

Zihan Zhang
KW21: Initial Literature review on colormap.
KW22: Literature review on topics: DTI, MRI, and Tractography
KW23: Install and explore CGV framework and familiarize with the code.
KW24: Review on colormap by Kenneth Moreland et al.
KW25: Implement colormap data of Blackbody and Extended blackbody. Preparation of slides for presentation and the speech.
KW26: Explore and install FSL software and take the course. Install MRIcron and MRIcroGL to get NIFTI file format from DICOM.
KW27: Familiarize with Diffusion MRI and do FA and MD calculation by FDT. 
KW28: Install 3D slicer to get data details. Compare TRK file with NIFTI file to get the connection. 
KW29: Implement volume rendering on DGV framework. Upload to github.
KW30: Fix dimension conversion and Eliminate invalid data to improve rendering accuracy. Upload to github.
KW31: Write report.(implement chapter)
KW32-33: Edit report and Provide images to support evaluation part.

Alaleh Kamel
KW20: General research on tractography and dMRI. 
KW21: Initial literature review on color mapping. Tried to install CGV on Mac. Tried to understand the details of the “Measuring the Effects of Scalar and Spherical Colormaps on Ensembles of DMRI Tubes” paper. 
KW22: Further work on installing CGV using VMWare on Mac: unsuccessful. The decision was that Mac users do more on the non-CGV part.
KW23: Tried to familiarize myself with mathematical concepts of Boy’s surface method (paper: Coloring 3D Line Fields Using Boy’s Real Projective Plane Immersion) 
KW24: Contact the authors of the Boy’s Surface paper to get exact the coefficients and functions they had used. Implemented the boy’s surface color mapping in C++ outside CGV. Helped with integrate it in CGV. 
KW25: Preparation of the intermediate presentation and slides. implementation of Boy’s surface method and Absolute Value method in MATLAB to generate some images.
KW26: Tried to understand the concepts of new tasks. Tried to install FSL software.
KW27: No work on team project due to Seminar presentation.
KW28-29: It was decided that I prepare the questionnaire so that teammate can implement it in CGV. Started the work on the questionnaire, trying to understand the design method, objectives, etc.  
KW30: (chickenpox) 
KW31: Designed the Questionnaire and uploaded it on GitHub. Discussions in the team to see what questions we can actually implemented. Started research on similar papers to find out more ideas about it. Tryied to design questions with minimum 3D rendering requirements.
KW32: Finally decided that only one question can be implemented. Carried out the questionnaire using the photos that Zihan had sent. Started writing the evaluation part of the report.
KW33: Evaluation of the results, statistics, and trying to justify them. Editing and revision of the group report, match the parts in LaTex and uploaded on GitHub.

Yu Kong 
KW21: Get basic knowledge of DMRI, tract data. 
KW22: Literature review on scalar colormap/Install CGV framework but fail/ Try to understand codes. 
KW23: Still trying to install CGV framework with Susu’s help, still fail/ Read papers of spherical colormap. 
KW24: Give up installing CGV and write codes of scalar colormap, Susu helps to test. 
KW25: Prepare for intermediate presentation. 
KW26: Get basic idea of FA and MD with FSL. 
KW27: Compute FA and MD/ Install 3D slicer. 
KW28: Have meeting with Susu& Zihan for codes of reading Nifti files with LAYNII. Since I have no CGV framework we work together in the classroom. 
KW29: Have meeting with Susu& Zihan, implement the FA and MD with colormaps with the help of David. 
KW30: Divide work for report. Prepare papers and result screenshots. Discuss the evaluation part. 
KW31: No work. 
KW32-33: write report Chapter 1 introduction, Chapter 2 scalar colormap& spherical colormap
