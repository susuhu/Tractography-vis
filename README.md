# Tractography visualization

###### developed based on [CGV framework](https://wwwpub.zih.tu-dresden.de/~gumhold/cgv/html/index.html)<br/>
* Literature review on real-time tube rendering with color mapping specific to tractography data.<br/>
* Study and implementation of ensemble scalar and orientation colormaps to visualise fiber tracts.<br/>
* Study and implementation of ensemble comparison and localization based on the chosen colormaps.<br/>
* Selection of viewpoints to conduct robust visualisation of dMRI fiber tube characteristics.<br/>
* Evaluation of the ensemble colormaps for accuracy and effectiveness of tract visualisation effects.<br/>
